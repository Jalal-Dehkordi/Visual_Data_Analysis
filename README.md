## Visual Data Analysis in Python

### Part 1: Visualization - From Simple Distributions to Dimensionality Reduction

In the field of Machine Learning, data visualization is crucial for all phases of a project. It helps in exploring data, understanding performance, and gaining insights.

### Introduction

Data visualization is not just about creating attractive graphics; it is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing data.

### Libraries Used

We'll be using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for visual exploration of data.

### Outline

## 1.Dataset
In this article, we'll be working with a dataset on customer churn for a telecom operator.

## 2. Univariate Visualization
### 2.1 Quantitative Features
We'll start by exploring the distribution of quantitative (numerical) features.
### 2.2 Categorical and Binary Features
Next, we'll examine the distribution of categorical and binary features.

## 3. Multivariate Visualization
### 3.1 Numerical vs. Numerical
We'll look at the correlations among the numerical variables.
###3.2 Numerical vs. Categorical
We'll explore the relationship between numerical and categorical variables.
### 3.3 Categorical vs. Categorical
We'll analyze relationships between categorical variables.


## 4. Whole Dataset Visualizations
### 4.1 Naive Approach
We can use histograms or scatter plot matrices to visualize all features at once.

### 4.2 Dimensionality Reduction
When dealing with high-dimensional data, we can use techniques like PCA for visualization.


### good luck
